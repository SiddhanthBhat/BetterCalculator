# BetterCalculator

## My first Foray into TKinter 

These files are my first foray in gui based applications for Python, They are quite simple and prioritize form over funtion


## Simple.py
  This is the first calculator I made. It is severely limited in functionality, It can take a Numeric Input followed by an operator and then another Number and perform the calculation.
  Obviously the main improvement that could be made was adding functionality for multiple operations to be accepted and computed at the end.
  
## Multi.py
  This is the second gui app I made.It can accept any number of inputs in the form of alternating Numbers and Operators and compute all of them at the end when the equals sign is pressed. This makes it on par with most simple calculators in terms of mathematical functionality, however you can always add more features, right!
  The Main drawback with most caalculators is that they compute numbers left to right with no priority system i.e they dont use DMAS (Division.Multiplication,Addition,Subtraction) rules. So I made a calculator that does do this.

## Expert.py
  This is the 3rd Calculator App I made, It does everything Multi.py does but when you press enter it evaluates the entire calculation and solves it with DMAS rules in mind, which means this is more advanced than most normal calculator applications.While I was at it I also spruced up the GUI a tiny bit to make it more user friendly. 
  
## Dependencies 
    - Python 3+
    - Tkinter
